The purpose of this respository is to experiment with some ideas learned in CS.601.231, Automata and Computation 
Theory. Principal goals are to create conversion algorithms between NFA, Regular Expressions, and DFAs and to do
related complexity analyses.

While I am certain these technologies likely already exist, getting to practice working with computational theory
ideas along with implementing them in code serves as a fun challenge in addition to helping enforce learning 
from Automata and Data Structures. There won't be a huge final product for this project, mainly a collection of
scripts.

Goals:
    Regular Expression -> NFA conversion + visualization
    NFA -> Regular Expression + visualization
    NFA -> DFA conversion + visualization
    DFA -> NFA conversion + visualization

I think the regex to NFA and vice versa will be pretty doable. The NFA to DFA (given the need for a super set) will
be a little nuanced. However, we are sure going to give it a shot!
